Comparative Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Sentiment Classification in IMDB Movie Reviews focuses on predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using various machine learning models. The dataset, comprising IMDB movie reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels, was initially preprocessed to remove noise, special characters, and stopwords, followed by text normalization through stemming.

Two feature extraction methods, Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), were employed to convert the textual data into numerical representations. These features were then used to train three different classification models: Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

The models' performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, revealing that Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes outperformed Linear SVM in accuracy for sentiment classification. Additionally, WordCloud visualizations provided insights into the most frequently occurring words in positive and negative reviews.

The project concludes that while the chosen models performed well, there is potential for further improvement through advanced preprocessing techniques and the integration of lexicon-based models for enhanced sentiment analysis.
